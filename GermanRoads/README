WARNING: Savegames with roads from this mod wont load without it!!! You have been warned! This Mod is very EXPERIMENTAL!!!

Updated for 1.1.1b!

This mod adds typical German Roads to the game, like the Bundesstrasse or Autobahn.
That be said, these new roads are just clones of existing road types with different properties. None of the built-in road types (NetInfo) is modified in any way!

Usage:
Open the roads menu, click the "GR" tab and you can draw and place the roads as you wish.

Features:
-> Bundesstrasse: Same as the Basic/Small Road but with speed 100. No zoning!
-> Bundesstrasse Four Lanes: Same as the Medium Road with four lanes, two for each direction, devided by a grass lane. Speed 100, no zoning!
-> Autobahn: Same as the Medium Road with four lanes, two for each direction, devided by the concrete lane. Speed 200!!! No zoning!
-> Autobahn Three Lanes One-way: Basically the same as the highway, but with Speed 200!!!
-> Autobahn Ramp: A two-lane oneway ramp with speed 80.
-> All roads run with the highwayRules, which (as far as I understand, could be wrong) prevents the AI from doing stupid stuff like parking on the Autobahn.
-> All roads are configured to NOT create traffic lights on intersections. If you need them anyway, use the mod "Toggle Traffic Lights". Works like a charm.
-> All traffic signs are correctly displayed (sadly there is no 200 sign).
-> Own thumbnails in the GR tab instead of the game ones

Limitations:
-> I already can read a "Hey, the german Autobahn normally has no speed limit, why not set it to 400+ then??" comment. Yeah, tried that as well :D , but all cars seem to have a top speed of 200 anyway.

Known Issues:
-> No preview images in the tooltips
-> While loading, the roads in the GR-Panel sometimes get mixed up. This is only a cosmetical error.
-> The Map-Editor and the game itself sometimes mixes up the GR panel and the SR (Some Roads) panel, leaves one of them or even both of them blank. Quite strange...
